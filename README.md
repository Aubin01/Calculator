# Calculator with Variables: A GUI-Based Arithmetic and Variable Assignment Tool

## Project Description
The Calculator with Variables project was developed as part of the Principles of Programming Languages course. The goal was to apply concepts learned during the course, such as lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation, to create a functional and user-friendly application. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, error handling, and a graphical user interface (GUI) with interactive features.

The project demonstrates the integration of programming language design concepts and GUI development using Python, PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), and PyQt6.

3. [How to Run the Code](#how-to-run-the-code)
4. [Outputs](#outputs)

## Files
1. **lexer.py**: Defines the tokens and tokenization rules using PLY for lexical analysis.
2. **parser.py**: Implements grammar rules for parsing expressions and variable assignments.
3. **interpreter.py**: Evaluates parsed expressions, performs computations, and handles errors.
4. **gui.py**: Implements the graphical user interface using PyQt6 for user interaction.
5. **calculator.png**: Screenshot of the calculator's GUI showing variable assignment and calculations.

### Additional Files
- **parser.out** and **parsetab.py**: Auto-generated files by PLY for parsing. These are created when you run the code for the first time.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - ply
  - PyQt6

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Aubin01/Calculator.git
```

2. Install required packages:
 ```bash
    pip install ply PyQt6
 ```

### How to Run the Code
**Step 1**: Run the GUI Application
    To launch the calculator's graphical user interface:
        python gui.py

**Step 2**: Interact with the Calculator
    Assign variables (e.g., x = 5 + 3).
    Perform arithmetic operations (e.g., x * 2).
    Display variable values using the print(variable_name) syntax.

### Outputs
The application generates two additional files when executed:

**parser.out**: Contains parsing state information for debugging (auto-generated by PLY).
**parsetab.py**: Stores parsing tables (auto-generated by PLY).

## GUI Output
Variable assignments: Displayed in green.
Calculation results: Displayed in blue.
Errors (e.g., division by zero, undefined variables): Displayed in red.
